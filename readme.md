arrayScan is a simple plugin for micro-manager 1.4.22.

arrayScan helps you quickly build a grid of XY positions and add them to the current Position List, for use with multi-dimensional acquisition with micro-manager. This is helpful for taking images at a particular constant spatial interval, for example when creating a tiled image of a large region.
